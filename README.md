## User Experience (UX)
### **Purpose**

CheckPoint's mission is to facilitate a peer-led support service to ex-servicemen and women who are struggling with mental health. The blog style of the site allows veterans to share their own experience and explore different ways of improving their health and well-being. The driving force behind this method of digital story sharing is to enable users to discuss their difficulties transitioning back to civilian life without the attached mental health stigma.


We hope that through the medium of blogging, veterans are able to share their experiences and explore different ways of improving their quality of life in a safe, unassuming environment.


Checkpoint allows the user to write their story and/or digitally upload their art. They can do this by taking a picture of their work and uploading it and/or write a blog post.

<br>

## Design
### **Colour Scheme**
The chosen colour scheme has been based on the colours of the British flag. These colours should resonate strongly with ex-servicemen and women.

### **Typography**


<br>

### **Imagery**
Logo: The logo has been created using [Canva](canva.com). The simple and inelaborate design features the colours of the British flag in line with the colour scheme throughout the site.

- Clear and simple font styling, avoiding any cursive or calligraphic scripts.
- Contrasting colour scheme, but avoiding colours that are too bold.
- Use of semantic HTML
- Ensuring all images have an alt description for screen readers or where the image cannot be loaded. Also ensuring that these are as descriptive as possible.
